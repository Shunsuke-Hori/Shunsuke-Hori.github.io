    Average hours worked per adult in Japan fell by around one third over the last half-century. The leading explanation focuses on government policies that distort labor supply decisions. This paper provides a new interpretation that stresses the role of income effects in preferences. Through the lens of a model of the market and home sectors and using non-homothetic preferences, I show that the main driver of Japan's decline in hours worked is income effects, rather than labor-market distortions or population aging. The model predicts that average hours of leisure will rise and home-production hours will remain roughly constant over the period, which is consistent with evidence from time-use surveys. An alternative calibration based on only labor market distortions counterfactually predicts that home production hours will rise.

    We conducted a large-scale retrospective survey to investigate how COVID-19 infection affected the labor outcomes of infected workers in Japan. Many infected workers—including those without any COVID-19 symptoms—experienced some reductions in hours worked or earnings immediately after infection. The negative labor impacts often lasted for more than a month. The negative labor impacts were particularly pronounced for contract workers, non-regular workers, workers without remote-work availability, and those unvaccinated. Our estimate based on the survey and other official statistics indicates that COVID-19 infection had a non-negligible negative impact on the aggregate labor supply in 2022.

    During the Covid-19 pandemic, many governments recommended quarantine to those who had close contact with infected individuals. We conducted a large-scale retrospective survey to study the consequences of such quarantine for labor outcomes. A sizable fraction of quarantined workers experienced reductions in hours worked and earnings, not only during quarantine but also after quarantine. Even uninfected workers experienced negative labor impacts, likely capturing the pure effects of quarantine independent of the effects of Covid-19 symptoms. Non-regular workers and workers without remote work options were more negatively affected by quarantine. We estimate that the quarantine resulted in a large reduction in the aggregate hours and that the reduction is mainly due to the scarring effects.

    How does a grayer society affect the political decision making regarding inflation rates? Is deflation preferred as society ages? In order to answer these questions, we compute the optimal inflation rates for the young and the old respectively and explore how they change with demographic factors, by using a New Keynesian model with overlapping generations. According to our simulation results, there indeed exists a tension between the young and the old on the optimal inflation rates. The optimal inflation rates are different between the young and the old. Also, they can be significantly different from zero, in particular, when heterogeneous impacts from inflation via nominal asset holdings are considered. The optimal inflation rates for the old can be largely negative, reflecting their positive nominal asset holdings as well as lower effective discount factor. Societal aging may exert downward pressure on inflation rates through a politico-economic mechanism.
