Average hours worked per adult in Japan fell by around one third over the last half-century. The leading explanation focuses on government policies that distort labor supply decisions. This paper provides a new interpretation that stresses the role of income effects in preferences. Through the lens of a model of the market and home sectors and using non-homothetic preferences, I show that the main driver of Japan's decline in hours worked is income effects, rather than labor-market distortions or population aging. The model predicts that average hours of leisure will rise and home-production hours will remain roughly constant over the period, which is consistent with evidence from time-use surveys. An alternative calibration based on only labor market distortions counterfactually predicts that home production hours will rise.
