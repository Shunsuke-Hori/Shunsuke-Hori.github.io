# Shunsuke-Hori.github.io
This is a repository for my personal website.

None of the templates were to my liking, so I decided to write some code myself.

# What I wanted
- A simple website with one Japanese and one English page.
- Header navigation with a website title and links to each page.
- Sidebar navigation with a table of contents.

## Some notes
- I borrowed color map from [here](https://colorhunt.co/palette/222831393e46d65a31eeeeee)
