My new webpage is https://shunsuke-hori.pages.dev/

I keep this repository just to setup a redirect page from the old page to the new page.

~~This repository contains the source code for my personal website hosted at https://shunsuke-hori.github.io~~

<!-- # Overview
None of the templates were to my liking, so I decided to write some code myself.
# What I wanted
- A simple website with one Japanese and one English page.
- Header navigation with a website title and links to each page.
- Sidebar navigation with a table of contents.

# Usage
- `git submodule init` and then `git submodule update --remote` to update the CV submodule
    - may not need `git submodule init`?

# Acknowledgments
